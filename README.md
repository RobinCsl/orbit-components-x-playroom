## [@kiwicom/orbit-components](https://orbit.kiwi) + [playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom) = ðŸ”¥

This is a Playroom for Kiwi.com's Orbit Components: it allows to design in the browser with JSX, and you can easily share your work with anyone through a link.

ðŸš€ [Live deployment](https://orbit-components-x-playroom.robincsl.now.sh)

Notes:
- the autocomplete only works for component names, sadly; a bit more work would be required to make the autocomplete available for props as well (i.e. turning all the components into TypeScript?!)
- there are more configuration options available for Playroom (see [ðŸ“š docs](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom#getting-started)), so feel free to clone the repo and run it locally too.
